        <a name="DefaultEnvironment">Default Environment</a></div>

        <p>Due to a cleanup in environment management the default environment of an application 
        is called <code>Default</code> from now on. <br>Previous versions of Xpert.ivy server have created a different name for 
        the default environment automatically. For example with a given application name <code>Foo</code> the name 
        of the default application was set to <code>Foo_Default</code>.<br>
        You may either leave your environments as before or clean up them 
        and get rid of your obsolete <code>Foo_Default</code> environment. 
        You can perform this work with the Engine AdminUI of Xpert.ivy 5.1 using its improved 
        Environment export/import feature.</p>

        The <em>IvyAddOns</em> project, which was delivered with Xpert.ivy 4.2,
        is not compatible with Xpert.ivy 4.3. 

        <p>In every application that uses the <em>IvyAddOns</em> project, a 4.3
        compatible <em>IvyAddOns</em> version must be re-deployed into the same
        process model version where the older version was deployed. </p>

        <p>The latest and compatible version of the <em>IvyAddOns</em> project
        can be found in the 4.3 server's <code>project</code>/ directory. </p>

        Migration of 3.9 server installations</div>
        Even though the <em>Xpert.ivy Designer</em> supports the import of 3.9
        projects since version 4.3, such projects still need considerable
        manual processing before they can be run on a 4.3 server. 

        <p><strong><span style="color:#ff0000">It is not possible to upgrade a
        running 3.9 server installation to a 4.3 installation
        directly.</span></strong></p>

        <p>Please consult the <em>Xpert.ivy 4.3 Designer Guide</em> (<em>&gt;
        Projects &gt; Converting old 3.x projects</em>) to learn more about how
        to convert 3.9 projects so that they can be run on a Xpert.ivy Server
        4.3.</p>

        Update to Java 6</div>

        <p>The Rich Dialog client does not support Java 5 any more. All clients
        using Rich Dialogs must upgrade to Java 6, if they not already using
        Java 6 (which is normally the case, if the JRE is configured to use
        automatic updates). </p>

        <p>Users with an old JRE will be redirected to the Java 6 update when
        they start a Rich Dialog. If your users do not have permissions to
        install Java on their machines, ensure that Java 6 is installed. </p>
