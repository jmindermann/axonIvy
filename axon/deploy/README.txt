Deployment-Directory

The deployment directory makes simple deployment of Axon.ivy projects to an Axon.ivy Engine
possible by copying the project into the deployment directory.

The deployment directory is by default the directory with the name 'deploy' in the Axon.ivy
Engine root directory. It can be altered trough the system property 'Deployment.Directory'.

There exists two possibilities how to deploy ivy projects through the deployment directory:
- File based deployment
- Maven deployment

Detailed instructions can be found in the Engine Guide (chapter "Deployment Directory"):
